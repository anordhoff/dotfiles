# modify_font

#: Modify font characteristics such as the position or thickness of
#: the underline and strikethrough. The modifications can have the
#: suffix px for pixels or % for percentage of original value. No
#: suffix means use pts. For example::

#:     modify_font underline_position -2
#:     modify_font underline_thickness 150%
#:     modify_font strikethrough_position 2px

#: Additionally, you can modify the size of the cell in which each
#: font glyph is rendered and the baseline at which the glyph is
#: placed in the cell. For example::

#:     modify_font cell_width 80%
#:     modify_font cell_height -2px
#:     modify_font baseline 3

#: Note that modifying the baseline will automatically adjust the
#: underline and strikethrough positions by the same amount.
#: Increasing the baseline raises glyphs inside the cell and
#: decreasing it lowers them. Decreasing the cell size might cause
#: rendering artifacts, so use with care.

#: }}}

undercurl_style thin-dense

#: The style with which undercurls are rendered. This option takes the
#: form (thin|thick)-(sparse|dense). Thin and thick control the
#: thickness of the undercurl. Sparse and dense control how often the
#: curl oscillates. With sparse the curl will peak once per character,
#: with dense twice.

# paste_actions quote-urls-at-prompt,confirm

#: A comma separated list of actions to take when pasting text into
#: the terminal. The supported paste actions are:

#: quote-urls-at-prompt:
#:     If the text being pasted is a URL and the cursor is at a shell prompt,
#:     automatically quote the URL (needs shell_integration).
#: replace-dangerous-control-codes
#:     Replace dangerous control codes from pasted text, without confirmation.
#: replace-newline
#:     Replace the newline character from pasted text, without confirmation.
#: confirm:
#:     Confirm the paste if the text to be pasted contains any terminal control codes
#:     as this can be dangerous, leading to code execution if the shell/program running
#:     in the terminal does not properly handle these.
#: confirm-if-large
#:     Confirm the paste if it is very large (larger than 16KB) as pasting
#:     large amounts of text into shells can be very slow.
#: filter:
#:     Run the filter_paste() function from the file paste-actions.py in
#:     the kitty config directory on the pasted text. The text returned by the
#:     function will be actually pasted.

strip_trailing_spaces never

#: Remove spaces at the end of lines when copying to clipboard. A
#: value of smart will do it when using normal selections, but not
#: rectangle selections. always will always do it.




default_pointer_shape arrow

#: Valid values are: arrow, beam and hand

clear_all_mouse_actions yes




# sync_to_monitor yes

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing)
#: when scrolling. However, it limits the rendering speed to the
#: refresh rate of your monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high
#: keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency. If
#: so, set this to no.

# remote_control_password

#: Allow other programs to control kitty using passwords. This option
#: can be specified multiple times to add multiple passwords. If no
#: passwords are present kitty will ask the user for permission if a
#: program tries to use remote control with a password. A password can
#: also *optionally* be associated with a set of allowed remote
#: control actions. For example::

#:     remote_control_password "my passphrase" get-colors set-colors focus-window focus-tab
#: Only the specified actions will be allowed when using this
#: password. Glob patterns can be used too, for example::

#:     remote_control_password "my passphrase" set-tab-* resize-*

#: To get a list of available actions, run::

#:     kitten @ --help

#: A set of actions to be allowed when no password is sent can be
#: specified by using an empty password. For example::

#:     remote_control_password "" *-colors

#: Finally, the path to a python module can be specified that provides
#: a function is_cmd_allowed that is used to check every remote
#: control command. For example::

#:     remote_control_password "my passphrase" my_rc_command_checker.py

#: Relative paths are resolved from the kitty configuration directory.
#: See rc_custom_auth <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-
#: control/#rc-custom-auth> for details.

# allow_remote_control yes
allow_remote_control no

#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on, other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc. Note that this even works over SSH
#: connections. The default setting of no prevents any form of remote
#: control. The meaning of the various values are:

#: password
#:     Remote control requests received over both the TTY device and the socket
#:     are confirmed based on passwords, see remote_control_password.

#: socket-only
#:     Remote control requests received over a socket are accepted
#:     unconditionally. Requests received over the TTY are denied.
#:     See listen_on.

#: socket
#:     Remote control requests received over a socket are accepted
#:     unconditionally. Requests received over the TTY are confirmed based on
#:     password.

#: no
#:     Remote control is completely disabled.

#: yes
#:     Remote control requests are always accepted.

clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary
# clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary read-clipboard-ask read-primary-ask

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: possible actions are: write-clipboard, read-clipboard, write-
#: primary, read-primary, read-clipboard-ask, read-primary-ask. The
#: default is to allow writing to the clipboard and primary selection
#: and to ask for permission when a program tries to read from the
#: clipboard. Note that disabling the read confirmation is a security
#: risk as it means that any program, even the ones running on a
#: remote server via SSH can read your clipboard. See also
#: clipboard_max_size.

# clipboard_max_size 512

#: The maximum size (in MB) of data from programs running in kitty
#: that will be stored for writing to the system clipboard. A value of
#: zero means no size limit is applied. See also clipboard_control.

shell_integration disabled
# shell_integration enabled

#: Enable shell integration on supported shells. This enables features

#: disabled to turn off shell integration, completely. It is also
#: possible to disable individual features, set to a space separated
#: list of these values: no-rc, no-cursor, no-title, no-cwd, no-
#: prompt-mark, no-complete, no-sudo. See Shell integration

#::  To get the command output that was last accessed by a keyboard

#::      map f1 show_last_visited_command_output

#::  You can pipe the output of the last command run in the shell

#::      map f1 launch --stdin-source=@last_cmd_output --stdin-add-formatting --type=overlay less +G -R

#::  To get the output of the first command on the screen, use
