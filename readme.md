# dotfiles

My dotfiles, leveraging neovim, tmux, and pseudo-tiling window managers to achieve a keyboard driven workflow in macOS and linux.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/anordhoff/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles; make init
```

## TODO

  1. look into [kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) as a replacement for kmonad, due to key-repeat issues with kmonad
  2. try using [selenized](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized) and [oksolar](https://meat.io/oksolar)
